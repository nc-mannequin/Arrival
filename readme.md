## _Requirements_
1) Design and implement a GUI program. The program must open at least 2 frames or dialogs, JOptionPane not counted. Use javax.swing package for containers and components. JavaFX forms and components are not allowed.
 - The class that opens the first frame/dialog must be named MainApplication.
2) The following components must be included in any frame/dialog:
 - JTextField, JPasswordField, or JTextArea
 - JCheckBox or JRadioButton : at least 5 items
 - JComboBox or JList : at least 5 items
 - JButton : one frame/dialog must have a button that opens another frame/dialog
 - An extra component (child class of JComponent) not taught in class, e.g. JSpinner, JSlider, JTable
 - Names and IDs of everyone in your group, as any component
3) Implement at least 4 event handlers. The handlers are counted by method names.
 - In order to be counted, the handlers must do something substantially (not just printing/showing message). Out of the 4 handlers, one of them must be to handle KeyEvent and another one to handle MouseEvent. The other 2 handlers can be to handle any event.
